# Online-Doctor-Appointment-System


Simple web project that made for e-solutions.

The purpose of this project is to create an online platform for medical establishments, such as clinics and hospitals, to facilitate the process of booking appointments with doctors for their clients or patients. The platform will help in organizing the schedules of appointments and provide a convenient and efficient method of scheduling appointments for both patients and doctors.

The system is composed of three main components: the administrator, the doctor, and the patient. The administrator is responsible for maintaining the list of doctors and their specialties, as well as their details and system credentials. The patients can access the platform through a website, where they can search for doctors based on their specialties and check the doctors' weekly schedules to determine the best day and time for an appointment.

Once the patient has found a suitable doctor, they can submit a request for an appointment through the platform. The doctor can then view their appointments and the appointment requests from patients to determine their availability.

This online doctor appointment system aims to streamline the process of booking appointments, making it more convenient and efficient for both patients and doctors. By automating the scheduling process, the platform will help to reduce wait times and improve the overall patient experience.
